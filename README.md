## Learning Objectives
* At least four different sorting algorithms
	* **Selection Sort**: <br /> **First pass**: <br /> * For the first position in the sorted array, the whole array is traversed from index 0 to 4 sequentially. The first position where 64 is stored presently, after traversing whole array it is clear that 11 is the lowest value.<br /> * Thus, replace 64 with 11. After one iteration 11, which happens to be the least value in the array, tends to appear in the first position of the sorted list.
